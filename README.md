## Intent
This project is intended as a program suite focused on the chip8.  
Upon completion it is supposed to contain:  
* An emulator/vm for the chip8
* A debugger
* A disassembler
* An assembler

## Background
The entire project is written in Rust witht the addition of sfml-bindings for rust.  
Worth noting is that this is written solely for my own amusement and with the sole purpose of me learning more about emulators and vms.
Whoever want to try it out or even modify it are welcome to do so!  
Please feel free to make pull requests if you have ways to better the code or find bugs.  

## Issues currently worked on
- [ ] Clockspeed/timer countdown
- [ ] Freezing upon collision
